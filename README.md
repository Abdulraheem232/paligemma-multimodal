# PaliGemma Multimodal – Overview

This project showcases **multimodal inference** with Google’s **PaliGemma** model — a vision-language model that combines image understanding with natural-language reasoning.

It demonstrates how to:

* Accept **image + text inputs** in a single pipeline.
* Perform **image captioning**, **visual question-answering**, and general **prompt-based reasoning**.
* Preprocess images (resize, normalize, align with model expectations) for consistent inference.
* Integrate Hugging Face’s `transformers` API for model loading and execution.

### Main Goals

* Provide a **clean reference** for running PaliGemma locally without additional web services.
* Highlight **step-by-step inference flow** from loading the model to generating answers.
* Make it easy for developers to extend the workflow into apps like chatbots, captioners, or analysis tools.

### What’s Inside

* A single Python script containing all model-loading and inference utilities.
* Sample usage instructions and comments within the script itself.
* Examples of prompts for captioning, question-answering, and description tasks.
* Lightweight image preprocessing pipeline suitable for most VLM workflows.

### Intended Audience

* Researchers, hobbyists, and engineers who want a **minimal example** of running PaliGemma.
* Anyone exploring **multimodal AI** for vision-language tasks.
